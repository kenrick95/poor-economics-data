# Poor Economics Data

The book [Poor Economics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10245602-poor-economics) has [a companion website](http://web.archive.org/web/20190414231629/www.pooreconomics.com/) that publishes an "18 country dataset" that is heavily referenced by this book. However, this website seemed to be unmaintained and now they just redirect themselves to the snapshot in the Internet Archive. The page to visualize the dataset, [as snapshoted by the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190414224929/http://www.pooreconomics.com/data/country/home), seemed to be mostly functional, only requiring some fixes to make it fully operational. This project aims to do that.
